<h2 style="text-align:center">Biography</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">Hello! I am a currently in my senior year of a computer science major at Montana State University. My main interests are web development, computer security, and artificial intelligence.
Mobile application development is also very intruiging to me. I have experience working as a web development contractor using WordPress and small amounts of JavaScript/PHP. My strongest language is definitely Java
but I also have experience in C, C#, C++, Ruby, and Python.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Every year I volunteer as a counselor at a camp for cancer patients and survivors. I have attended this camp since I was 8 years old and it means the world to me. I strive to be able to improve the lives
of people of all ages suffering from illnesses of all magnitudes.
