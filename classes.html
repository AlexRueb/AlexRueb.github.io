<h1>These are classes I have taken at MSU that I believe have progressed my knowledge the most</h1>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>The main takeaway from this class was utilizing the main search algorithms and putting them to use.
We used sorting methods like A*, Depth/Breadth first search, and Greedy. We used these algorithms mostly in mazes
to get to the end or simulating bots to solve various puzzle games.
</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>This class used Python and was centered around simulating a network connection, watching packet flow and creating 
simulated routers/users. We had multiple group projects where we would create different user devices and routers, and try 
to send packets from one user to another using different routers based of traffic constraints and distance.
</p>

<h3>Computer Security</h3>
<p>During this class we studied different methods of exploitation from the physical layer to the network layer. There was 
simulations where we would take encrypted data and decode it looking for (faked) credit card data and personal data.
</p>

<h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
<p>This class focused on the bottom layer of computers. We used assembly and even binary to make basic programs that could
swap values in memory. The class taught me about how computers actually work and the data flow from binary to compiler.
</p>

<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>Software engineering is an extremely important aspect of computer science, because to make any sustainable program there 
must be ample planning put into the project. This class taught me the importance of serious planning and testing. We went over 
many different common design principles in programs from a website to the SpaceX launches.
